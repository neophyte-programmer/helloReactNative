# Hello React Native
This is a simple React Native app. I am using it to learn React Native. 

## About React Native & Expo
### React Native
React Native is a JavaScript-based mobile app framework for building natively rendered apps using React. It was created by Facebook and is used by a large number of companies, such as AirBnB, to build native mobile apps. It is open source and free to use. Read more about React Native at [here](https://www.netguru.com/glossary/react-native).

### Expo
Expo is a set of tools built on top of React Native. These tools depend on one key belief held at Expo: it's possible to build most apps without ever needing to write native code, provided that you have a comprehensive set of APIs exposed to JavaScript. Read more about Expo [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39170622/what-is-the-difference-between-expo-and-react-native).
## Important Stuff
- I had to download the LTS version of React Native to get expo to work.
- I installed expo using the command:
``` npm install -g expo-cli ```
- I initialized the project using the command:
``` expo init helloReactNative ```
- I installed Expo Go on my phone and scanned the QR code to preview the app.
